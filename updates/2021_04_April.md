It seems that the only thing on my list I finished is making *Taro Ball with Sweet Red Bean Soup*, and read part of the 
[Cracking the Data Science Interview](https://github.com/khanhnamle1994/cracking-the-data-science-interview/tree/master/Cheatsheets#machine-learning-concepts).
While reading, I realized that I was and am so not ready for any data science related jobs. I sucked and suck. 

One thing not on my list but I've done is that I watched the movie *Key of Life*, well, I've been looking forward to watching it for a while, 
and given that what I've been through, I think I deserve one movie this week. 

However, I found that recently I am reluctant to any workout, which I regret every time at the end of the day.

I made *Brown Sugar Pudding Cake*, which is not something new to me, tasty and satisfying for a sweet teeth, but I felt 
guilty for a day I ate too much, and did not exercise...
