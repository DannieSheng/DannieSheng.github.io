It seems that the only thing on my list I finished is making *Taro Ball with Sweet Red Bean Soup*, and read part of the 
[Cracking the Data Science Interview](https://github.com/khanhnamle1994/cracking-the-data-science-interview/tree/master/Cheatsheets#machine-learning-concepts).
While reading, I realized that I was and am so not ready for any data science related jobs. I sucked and suck. 

One thing not on my list but I've done is that I watched the movie *Key of Life*, well, I've been looking forward to watching it for a while, 
and given that what I've been through, I think I deserve one movie this week. 

However, I found that recently I am reluctant to any workout, which I regret every time at the end of the day.

I made *Brown Sugar Pudding Cake*, which is not something new to me, tasty and satisfying for a sweet teeth, but I felt 
guilty of a day I ate too much, and did not exercise...

Things I've learned from today's interview:

- Include patient numbers into the resume for EHR analysis
- Provide former employers as my references

It is always hard for me to get things done when life is not in a "stable" condition, I am really not good at dealing with changes.
I am trying, I am working hard, but I just need much time. 

Another key thing is to "get started". I had a hard time to get up, get changed and start work out during weekends. 
That's the reason I did not work out during the weekend, and I feel guilty afterwards. I started to hesitate about 
working out again this afternoon, but finally got up and found it is not so hard once get started. 
The same situation is applicable when I lie on couch watching *Friends* eposide after eposide, worrying about what I should have done, 
but don't want to move at all and just keep watching. That is really my problem.
