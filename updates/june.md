I cannot believe it is already July, half of year 2021 has past. I've celebrated one-year anniversary of 
starting work the past February, which also reminded me of being working from home for one year and a half. 

The past (almost) 6 months mark an important change in my life - I "officially" live together with my partner
the first time. We rent our own apartment without sharing with any roommates. It has been great to have somebody
share the meal, to watch *Friends* (favorite show for both of us) together all over agaion. We've tried a lot of
new recipes together, most of them are me trying new sweet treats (hopefully in healthier version. Several most remarkable 
ones are: making dumplings from scretch, making longevity noodles (one serving of noodles consist with only one noodle) 
from scretch, homemade strawberry birthday cake with fresh cream. 

Speaking of eating, I've been trying hard to build up a healthier eating habit during the past several months. Mostly 
because I stay at home for a long time (if not all the time, which is depressed), and I have been eager to try out new 
recipes almost every day. Preparing meal and baking have been my way to relax myself. I also found that healthy food can 
be very delicious the same time. However, living together means that sometimes I would be tempted with some "delicious 
unhealthy" food. Though I tried my best to be healthy, I cannot say no to those delicious food. I am glad to see that he 
enjoyed those healthy meal I prepared, and started to eat brown rice, or quiona, and not buying prepared food all the 
time. Anyways I think the key point is to keep a clear mind of "healthy living", but still enjoy food once a while. 

One thing of living together I don't enjoy much is the cleanness. It has been annoying that he does not put everything 
their fixed places, and clothes are everywhere on the floor. Every weekend when I tried to do the cleaning, I did not 
know where to start. The worst thing is that he doesn't have the mindset of "cleaning the apartment" or "keeping the 
apartment clean". To be honest, I don't feel like doing anything in a dirty and untidy place.
