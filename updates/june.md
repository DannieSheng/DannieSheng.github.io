I cannot believe it is already July, half of year 2021 has past. I've celebrated one-year anniversary of 
starting work the past February, which also reminded me of being working from home for one year and a half. 

The past (almost) 6 months mark an important change in my life - I "officially" live together with my partner
the first time.
